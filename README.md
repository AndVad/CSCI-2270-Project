There will a health-based system where answering a question wrong will lose you health or some other measure of points

# Project Summary
The goal of this game is to get to your home while achieving the highest amount of points possible.Depending on the difficutly you chose your path home may be more rigorous. In every adventure you will be given various tasks to complete, all of which have an easy option,medium option and a hard option. If you take the easy way on any given task, you will not lose any health when completing the task but will not gain any points. Each instance will be a yes or no choice as to whether or not you'd like to attempt the task, and points/health will be updated accordingly. At any point in the game you may stop to check the status of your character, change the weapon they are weilding, and much more as represented by the main menu.
